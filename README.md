# pi_scalextric

Have a look at the [schematic](https://aliceliveprojects.github.io/pi_scalextric/).

## Project Structure
* [pi_scalextric_mqtt](https://github.com/aliceliveprojects/pi_scalextric_mqtt) contains mqtt broker setup, python scripts and configuration files
* [pi_scalextric_spwa](https://github.com/aliceliveprojects/pi_scalextric_spwa) contains a simple single page web app to control scalextrix cars via mqtt

---

### TL;DR â€“ *You can skip most of this article if you do the following:*
1) Clone `pi_scalextric_mqtt` onto Raspberry Pi

1) Edit the `config.json`, `resources.json` and `sensors.json` files with appropriate details

1) Run `node-red-start` and copy the `mqtt_flow.json` flow

1) Change global context: configPath to the absolute path to the `config.json` file

1) Setup new Mqtt connections for each Mqtt module and deploy


1) Run `python qrCodeGen.py [PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE] [HOST_OF_SPWA]`

1) Generated Qr code can be scanned to direct users to SPWA







## How To

Here's how I'm setting up the system:

Please note: to run an MQTT server on Heroku will require a credit card, even if on a free tier. 

The best, safest, way to do this, is to obtain a top-up credit-card, such as one from [Pockit](https://www.pockit.com/) (Other Top-up cards are available). It will ensure that if something goes wrong, and a charge to the card is attempted, there are no funds available, and you won't fall into debt without being aware!

1. Web: Create a project alias on a GMail account

1. Web: Create a Heroku account, using the project alias

1. Web: Create an app in the Heroku account

1. Web: Add the CloudMQTT element to the app in the Heroku account (you'll need to provide a credit card for this)

1. Web: Find the connection details in the app's Config Vars

1. Dev Machine: Use an [MQTT debug client](http://www.mqttfx.org/) to check all is OK

1. Download fresh [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

1. Pi: [Install](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) onto SD Card.

1. Boot Pi from SD Card, into Desktop

1. Pi: Update Raspbian

1. Pi: Update Node-RED
   1. see [Node-RED update for Raspberry Pi](https://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi)
   1. start the Node-RED server, as instructed

1. Pi: Install a [git gui](https://git-cola.github.io/downloads.html) if you really can't be bothered with command line

1. Pi: Clone the [pi_scalextric_node_red](https://github.com/aliceliveprojects/pi_scalextric_node_red) project

1. Pi: Clone the [pi_scalextric_mqtt](https://github.com/aliceliveprojects/pi_scalextric_mqtt) project

1. Pi: Alter the config file:
   * located at path: `<pi_scalextric_mqtt>/mqtt/src/config.json`
      * set the values for the broker as those you have in your MQTT broker account 'details'.
      * set the values for the paths:
         * resources: `<pi_scalextric_mqtt>/mqtt/src/pythonScripts/specialWeaponScripts`
         * throttle: `<pi_scalextric_mqtt>/mqtt/src/pythonScripts/throttleScripts/channel_throttle.py`
         * sensors: `<pi_scalextric_mqtt>/mqtt/src/pythonScripts/sensorScripts/sensors.py`


1. Pi: Node-RED: import the project:
   * Edit `<pi_scalextric_node_red>/node_red_flow.txt`. Select all,copy to clipboard.
   * Install missing node types, using the 'Manage Palette' menu.
      * (Note: If this doesn't exist, you don't have npm running)
      * install `node-red-contrib-mqtt-dynamictopic`: NOTE really important not to confuse this with node-red-contrib-mqtt-dynamic
      * install `node-red-contrib-grovepi`
1. Pi: Node-RED: change parameters
   *  Mqtt Subscribe: Set Global Context: configPath
      * set value to the path: `<pi_scalextric_mqtt>/mqtt/src/config.json`
   *  Mqtt Subscribe: Set sensor definition path
      * Set value on the Sensors File node: `<pi_scalextric_mqtt>/mqtt/src/sensors.json`
1. Pi:Node-RED: set the mqtt connection parameters
   * select any one of the Nodes of type: **mqtt-dynamic**
   * in the [sidebar](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/) click on the gear icon to bring up the configuration
   * the configuration sets the values for all nodes of this type.
   * set the MQTT connection info to the same as that entered for the `config.json`
1. Pi: Python: Install packages for mqtt - python checks the sensor values and sends to MQTT.
   * `pip install paho-mqtt`
